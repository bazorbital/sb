Smooth Booking ensures the booking database environment is ready for custom scheduling workflows and now ships with full employee, customer, service, and appointment management tooling.

== Description ==
Smooth Booking validates and creates required database tables on activation and at runtime to guarantee a healthy environment for booking features. It ships with a schema status dashboard, REST API endpoints, shortcode, Gutenberg block, employee/customer/service/appointment management UIs, and WP-CLI tooling for administrators.
Administrators can also define per-location business hours templates that inform new staff defaults and optional calendar visibility hours.
Administrators can now configure per-location holidays from a yearly calendar, including date ranges, recurring closures, and color-coded statuses that surface in the admin UI and WP-CLI tooling.
Administrators gain a dedicated **Locations** workspace to capture physical or virtual venues with media-powered profile images, address/phone/email/website fields, industry selection, event toggles, company details, and soft delete/restore workflows powering business hours, holidays, REST, and CLI automation.
Administrators can assign employees to one or more locations, toggle service availability with custom price overrides, and configure per-day working hours with optional breaks directly inside the Employees drawer.
Administrators can manage booking-related email notifications, choose recipients, restrict by services, attach ICS files, and design HTML/Text content with placeholder codes. Email delivery preferences are configurable under **Smooth Booking → Settings → Email**, including SMTP credentials, retry periods, and test-sending.
Administrators gain a dedicated **Calendar** view under **Smooth Booking → Calendar** to inspect each location's day-at-a-glance schedule with employee columns, configurable time-slot granularity, appointment colour-coding from service palettes, inline creation via modal, quick edit/delete affordances, and service/location/staff filters with Select2 multi-selects and chip-style toggles.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `smooth-booking` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install via Composer.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" screen in WordPress.
3. Visit **Smooth Booking → Locations** to register venues, **Smooth Booking → Appointments** to manage bookings, **Smooth Booking → Services** to configure offerings, **Smooth Booking → Employees** to create staff profiles, **Smooth Booking → Customers** to manage client records, and **Smooth Booking → Settings** to review schema health and configure automatic repairs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does the plugin support multisite? =
Yes. Activation, deactivation, and uninstall operations run across all sites when network activated.

= How can I verify the schema from the command line? =
Use WP-CLI:

`wp smooth schema status`

= Can I manage locations, employees, customers, services, and appointments programmatically? =
Yes. Use the REST API at `/wp-json/smooth-booking/v1/locations`, `/wp-json/smooth-booking/v1/employees`, `/wp-json/smooth-booking/v1/customers`, `/wp-json/smooth-booking/v1/services`, and `/wp-json/smooth-booking/v1/appointments` or the CLI commands `wp smooth locations <list|create|update|delete|restore>`, `wp smooth employees <list|create|update|delete|restore>`, `wp smooth customers <list|create|update|delete|restore>`, `wp smooth services <list|create|update|delete|restore>`, and `wp smooth appointments <list|delete|restore>`.

== Changelog ==
= 0.15.0 =
* Replaced the bespoke calendar grid with an EventCalendar-powered timeline that renders employee columns, honours slot lengths, and paints appointments using their service colours directly from the schedule payload.
* Wired appointment actions, edit/delete affordances, and the shared booking modal to the EventCalendar instance so creating or maintaining bookings from the calendar keeps the existing workflows intact.

= 0.14.0 =
* Added service, location, and staff filters to the Calendar workspace with Select2 multi-selects so administrators can focus on specific offerings and providers per location.
* Introduced quick staff toggle buttons that mirror the location roster, including an “All staff” shortcut, while keeping selections in sync with the filter form.
* Enhanced appointment cards with consistent filtering logic so only the selected staff/service combinations render, and surfaced guidance when no staff are selected.

= 0.13.1 =
* Fix: Reinitialised the notification drawer editor on open so TinyMCE no longer triggers asynchronous listener errors when adding a new email notification. Editor scripts are now enqueued explicitly and refreshed whenever the drawer becomes visible.

= 0.13.0 =
* Added a Calendar workspace that renders location-specific employee columns, configurable time slots, colour-coded appointments, and inline creation/edit/delete actions surfaced through the shared appointment modal.
* Introduced General settings for time-slot length that drive both the appointment forms and calendar grid, alongside repository support for retrieving employee appointments within a daily range.
* Extended appointment entities with service colour metadata, delivered dedicated calendar JavaScript/CSS assets, and shipped PHPUnit coverage for the new settings sanitisation and calendar aggregation logic.

= 0.12.0 =
* Revamped the Employees drawer with tabbed General, Location, Services, and Schedule sections so administrators can manage locations, visibility, service availability, and working hours from a single panel.
* Added per-employee service price overrides with validation to prevent negative or non-numeric entries and persisted overrides in the repository layer.
* Introduced a weekly schedule editor that supports copying hours, applying location templates, and defining multiple breaks per day with client-side controls and server-side validation.
* Updated admin JavaScript and CSS to power the new tab navigation, service toggles, and schedule interactions while localizing schedule data seeded from location business hours.
* Expanded PHPUnit coverage with tests for service pricing validation and schedule sanitisation in the employee domain service.

= 0.11.0 =
* Added Email Notifications admin screen with drawer-based creation/editing, recipient targeting (client, employee, administrators, custom), per-status filters, service scoping, Select2 multi-selects, placeholder tables, and soft delete/disable workflows.
* Introduced notification domain models, repository, and schema tables for channels, recipients, templates, rules, send jobs, attempts, suppression list, and delivery events alongside PHPUnit coverage.
* Added Email settings tab with sender identity, send format, reply-to behaviour, retry windows, SMTP credentials with dynamic field visibility, and nonce-protected submissions plus test email action.
* Extended Locations with configurable time zones (defaulting to Europe/Budapest) and ensured CRUD flows persist the timezone value.

= 0.10.0 =
* Added Locations administration screen with media-powered profile images, address/phone/email/website capture, industry dropdowns, event toggle, and soft delete/restore workflows.

* Expanded database schema for `smooth_locations` to store contact channels, company metadata, and profile image IDs, and wired repositories with object cache support.

= 0.9.0 =
* Added Holidays settings tab with a yearly calendar per location, range selection, recurring closures, and color-coded styling.

= 0.8.0 =
* Added a Business Hours configuration section under Settings allowing administrators to select a location and define opening/closing times for each day of the week with 15-minute intervals.
* Persisted location-specific business hours templates using nonces, capability checks, and WordPress Settings styling so calendar visibility and new staff defaults stay aligned.

= 0.7.0 =
* Added Appointments administration screen with searchable filters, soft delete/restore, Select2-powered provider/service/customer dropdowns, schedule selectors, and notification toggles matching the existing admin design system.

* Registered REST API routes at `/wp-json/smooth-booking/v1/appointments` with list, create, update, delete, and restore operations plus pagination filters.

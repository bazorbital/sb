# Smooth Booking

Smooth Booking ensures that the booking-specific database schema is provisioned and exposes tools to manage booking resources.

- Schema health overview and configuration page under **Smooth Booking → Settings**
- Location, employee, customer, service, and appointment directories with profile images, configurable colors, tag assignment, soft-delete/restore actions, searchable tables, and 2025-ready admin headers with on-demand creation/edit drawers
- Employee drawer with tabbed General/Location/Services/Schedule sections supporting location assignment, per-service price overrides, and a weekly schedule editor with break management seeded from location business hours
- Locations workspace featuring media-powered profile images, address/phone/email/website capture, industry selection with optgroups, event location toggle, company details, soft delete/restore workflow, and WP media integration

## Installation
1. Copy the `smooth-booking` directory into `wp-content/plugins/` or install via Composer.
2. Run `composer install` if you need the development dependencies.
3. Activate **Smooth Booking** from the Plugins screen or via WP-CLI: `wp plugin activate smooth-booking`.

## Usage
- Visit **Smooth Booking → Appointments** to create and manage bookings: pick a provider, service, date, and time range; optionally capture customer overrides, internal notes, recurrence flag, and notification preferences. Filter the table by ID, schedule window, creation window, status, employee, service, or customer name, and use soft delete/restore actions.
- Visit **Smooth Booking → Services** to create offerings with dedicated General/Time/Additional tabs, provider preferences (including occupancy windows and random tie-breaking), color pickers, payment method selections, online meeting providers, customer booking limits, and soft-delete/restore workflows. Use the prominent **Add new** button to open the creation drawer only when you need it.
- Visit **Smooth Booking → Locations** to capture physical and virtual locations with media-powered profile images, address/phone/email fields, website URLs, industry taxonomy, event toggle, company details, and soft delete/restore controls.
- Visit **Smooth Booking → Employees** to manage staff members, add new employees, edit existing profiles, or soft-delete entries. The refreshed drawer includes tabbed General, Location, Services, and Schedule sections with media library profile images, WordPress color pickers, visibility options, category assignment, location availability toggles, per-service price overrides, and day-by-day working hours with break management sourced from location business hours.
- Visit **Smooth Booking → Customers** to capture client information, upload profile imagery, assign or create tags, connect WordPress users, and manage soft-deleted records via searchable, sortable, and paginated tables.
- Visit **Smooth Booking → Email notifications** to configure automated emails for booking events, choose recipients (client, employee, administrators, custom), limit by appointment status or services, attach ICS files, and compose HTML/Text bodies with placeholder codes.
- Configure schema repair behaviour under **Smooth Booking → Settings**.
- Configure sender identity, format, reply-to handling, retry periods, and SMTP credentials under **Smooth Booking → Settings → Email**, and send a test message to confirm delivery.
- Define default open and close times per location under **Smooth Booking → Settings → Business Hours**, then apply the template to inform staff schedules and calendar visibility when “Show only business hours in the calendar” is enabled.
- Mark company-wide closures per location under **Smooth Booking → Settings → Holidays** by selecting days or ranges, adding notes, and optionally repeating the closure every year. Existing holidays appear beside the calendar for quick removal.
